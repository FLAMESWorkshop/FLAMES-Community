# FLAMES Workshop - Key Dates & Updates

This file contains important dates, updates, and relevant information regarding the **FLAMES Workshop - Fluid Simulations of the Left Atrium with Multi-source Experimental Studies**.

## 📅 **Key Dates**

- **May 16, 2025** → Submission deadline for simulation results (inclusive).
- **June 1–5, 2025** → Presentation of results and methodologies at **FIMH25 Conference** (Texas, USA). Hybrid participation available.
- **September 3–5, 2025** → Second in-person participant meeting at **CMBBE25 Conference** (Barcelona, Spain).

## 📢 **Workshop Overview**

The FLAMES workshop organizers have compiled a **validation dataset**, integrating different imaging modalities, to enable the community to perform **verification and benchmarking studies**. The goal is to identify the most promising strategies and address existing challenges in left atrium (LA) fluid simulations.

### 📂 **Available Datasets**

1. **In Vitro Data** → PIV experiments conducted by **Fondazione Toscana G. Monasterio, Massa, Italy**.
2. **4D Flow MRI Data** → Collected by **Hospital Clínic de Barcelona**, curated by **Universitat Pompeu Fabra, Barcelona, Spain**.
3. **Dynamic Opacity CT Data** → Collected by **University of California San Diego, La Jolla, CA**, curated by **University of Washington, Seattle, USA**.

### 🏆 **How to Participate**

- Participants will receive essential data (e.g., **geometrical domain, boundary conditions**) after signing and returning the **Data Sharing Consent Agreement** to `flamesworkshop25@gmail.com`.
- Simulation results must be submitted by **May 16, 2025**, following a **predetermined format**.
- Results will be presented at **FIMH25** and **CMBBE25** conferences.

## 🤝 **A Collaborative Effort**

The FLAMES workshop is **not a competition** but a **collaborative initiative**. Each research team contributes their expertise and results, fostering collective scientific progress. The final outcome will be a **co-authored scientific paper**, summarizing key findings and methodologies (anonymized to focus on collective insights rather than individual performance).
