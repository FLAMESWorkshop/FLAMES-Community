# FLAMES Workshop - Community Hub & Updates

Welcome to the **FLAMES Workshop Community Hub!**  

This repository serves as the central platform for **sharing updates, discussing ideas, and answering questions** about the **FLAMES Workshop - Fluid Simulations of the Left Atrium with Multi-source Experimental Studies**.  

🚨 **Note**: This repository **does not contain datasets or experimental data**. If you are a participant, remember that the data is available in the private repository. If you have not yet requested access, please contact the organizers through email to facilitate your access!

## 🔍 **About the Workshop**  

The FLAMES workshop organizers have compiled a **validation dataset**, integrating different imaging modalities, to enable the community to perform **verification and benchmarking studies**. The goal is to identify the most promising strategies and address existing challenges in left atrium (LA) fluid simulations using multi-source experimental data, including: 

✔ **In Vitro experiments** (3D-printed phantom + PIV measurements)  
✔ **4D Flow MRI data** (patient-specific imaging + segmentations)  
✔ **Dynamic Opacity CT scans** (time-dependent imaging of the left heart)  

The goal is to **advance computational modeling techniques** by leveraging these datasets and encouraging collaboration among researchers.
