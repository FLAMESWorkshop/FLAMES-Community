# FLAMES Workshop - Community Hub & Updates

Welcome to the **FLAMES Workshop Community Hub!**  

This repository serves as the central platform for **sharing updates, discussing ideas, and answering questions** about the **FLAMES Workshop - Fluid Simulations of the Left Atrium with Multi-source Experimental Studies**.  

🚨 **Note**: This repository **does not contain datasets or experimental data**. If you are a participant, remember that the data is available in the private repository. If you have not yet requested access, please contact the organizers through email to facilitate your access!

## 🔍 **About the Workshop**  

The FLAMES workshop organizers have compiled a **validation dataset**, integrating different imaging modalities, to enable the community to perform **verification and benchmarking studies**. The goal is to make use of advanced computational modeling techniques to address existing challenges in left atrium (LA) fluid simulations using multi-source experimental data, including: 

✔ **In Vitro experiments** (3D-printed phantom + PIV measurements)  
✔ **4D Flow MRI data** (patient-specific imaging + segmentations)  
✔ **Dynamic Opacity CT scans** (time-dependent imaging of the left heart)

## ✍️ **How to Participate**

- Participants will receive the aforementioned data after signing and returning through email the **Data Sharing Consent Agreement** to the organizers.
- Once you have access to the data, you can begin experimenting with the different datasets offered! We encourage you to explore the various data sources and apply your methods to contribute to the understanding of LA hemodynamics.
